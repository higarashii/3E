      <h1>OUR LADY OF MT. MATUTUM</h1>

<p>About 15 kilometers from the town center of Polomolok is a road that leads to the Trappistine Monastery of Our Lady of Mount Matutum. It is located at the foot of Mt. Matutum in Barangay Landan in Polomolok South Cotabato, after which the monastery got its name. It is home to about 30 or so Trappistine nuns under the Cistercian Order which originated in France.</p>

<p>The Trappistine Monastery is a place of prayer, meditation and reflection. The steep drive up the monastery leads to their guest house, where the Stations of the Cross can be found on one side of the road. The guest house is open for visitors and accommodation may be arranged for those who want to go on a retreat or recollection.</p>

<p>Upon entering the place, a small chapel can be found, a few steps up from the parking lot. It has a view of the rolling hills on the horizon. It is where Eucharistic exposition and adoration may be held for those seeking some moments of silence and solitude in front of the Blessed Sacrament. Below the small chapel are three rooms for guests and visitors. A few meters from the chapel is a cottage with two rooms intended for guest priests who may be visiting the place or who may be facilitating a retreat or a recollection.</p>
