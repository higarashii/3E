   <h1>Biak-na-Bato National Park</h1>
    <p>Biak-na-Bato National Park is a protected area of the Philippines located almost entirely within Barangay Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel, Bulacan from where it derives its name. The park also extends to the nearby municipalities of San Ildefonso and Doña Remedios Trinidad covering a total area of 2,117 hectares (5,230 acres).[1] It was declared a national park in 1937 by President Manuel L. Quezon by virtue of its association with the history and site of the Biak-na-Bato Republic. The park consists of a cave network and a system of rivers and trails of both historical and ecological importance. Situated only 80 kilometers (50 mi) northeast from Manila, it is fast becoming a popular weekend eco-adventure destination for the city dwellers.<p>

<p>Biak-na-Bato National Park is centered on a mountain gorge sliced by the Balaong River in the Sierra Madre mountain range. More than a hundred caves of varying sizes and crystalline mineral formations are spread across the park. Among the most explored caves are the Aguinaldo Cave, once the headquarters of President Emilio Aguinaldo, and the Bahay Paniki or Bat Cave. Orchids, trees, shrubs, ferns, bushes and bokawe (buho) are some of the flora than can be found in the park.<p>

<p>Observation outposts of the former republic as well as ruins of stone fortifications also abound within the park, including a stone cliff with carvings, possibly over a hundred years old, Mount Susong Dalaga and Tilandong Falls are also popular attractions inside the park.<p>

<p>It is called Bahay Paniki. There are lots of bats in the cave and the surrounding smells like bat poop. The tour guide says, “the bat poop is being used as a fertilizer by some people here". A isolated cave situated at Biak-na-Bato, Trinidad Tecson, so called "Mother of Biak na Bato," was born here.<p>
