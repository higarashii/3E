It also boasts of three hot springs – Bucalan Hot Spring, Bungol Hot Spring, and Mambucal Hot Springs which, along with Mambukal Mountain Resort, is managed by the provincial government of Negros Occidental.<p>

<p>Mount Kanlaon is surrounded by different myths as to how it formed. There's a story that is very well known to the locals and that it was home to a datu named Laon while the volcano was said to be a place where a seven-headed dragon used to live and was slain by the youthful epic hero, Kan, who was an intimate friend and lover of Laon. Several years later a volcano was formed in the mountain which people from the past believed that the spirit of the dragon lived.<p>
