   <h1>San Salvador Island</h1>
    <p>San Salvador Island is located in Philippines. Let us guide you to explore San Salvador Island and uncover its beauty. Find inspirations about popular tourist attractions, travel tips, to the best accommodation in Zambales here. Plan your next adventure at Traveloka!<p>

<p>San Salvador is also called the land of lakes and Columbus’ Isle. It is about 12 miles long and five miles wide. Its original name was Guanahani. Later it was called Watling’s Island after George Watling, a noted buccaneer. <p>

<p>Until recently, San Salvador was considered one of the least important islands of The Bahamas. However, with the quincentennial celebrations in 1992, San Salvador attracted much attention as it has been for years identified as the first landfall of Christopher Columbus in the New World. He landed at San Salvador on October 12, 1492, and was greeted by the friendly Lucayan Arawaks.<p>

<p>San Salvador has a rich history: the depopulation of its indigenous population by the Spaniards; the use of its inlets by pirates and buccaneers; the coming of the Loyalists and their slaves; the coming of the Americans during the Second World War and its aftermath; and more recently, the advent of the tourist industry.<p>
