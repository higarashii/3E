      <h1>HAGIMIT FALLS</h1>

<p>Hagimit Falls is one of the most popular attractions on Samal Island. The resort island is known for its multitude of pocket beaches owned by resorts. But Samal is also home to a few inland attractions that are worth visiting. If the beach heat is too hot, the cool waters of Hagimit Falls are the perfect alternative. Plus the canopy of trees provides a much-needed shade.</p>
<p>Hagimit Falls are actually clusters of waterfalls. There are a good number of waterfall clusters found in the area. Some are suitable for small children while some are strictly for adults. The waterfalls’ drop is not at all high, perhaps just five feet but the pools are deep in some places. It is best to stick to areas marked as safe for kids.</p>
<p>The water of Hagimit Falls is cool and relaxing. It also helps that the surrounding trees provide shade. Hagimit Falls is perfect for when you want to enjoy the water without getting sunburned. It is also a great place to commune with nature.</p>
