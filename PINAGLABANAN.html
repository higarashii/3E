   <h1> Pinaglabanan Shrine </h1>
    <p> Pinaglabanan Shrine is a Filipino national shrine and park located on N. Domingo corner Pinaglabanan Street in the city of San Juan, Metro Manila, Philippines. The shrine has a statue of a woman supported by two children, holding up a bolo, or a machete.<br>This was created to commemorate the opening salvo of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, when local independence fighters known as Katipuneros laid siege to the Spanish Colonial Government's munitions storage facility, known as the almacen. The city seal depicts this statue. It houses the Pinaglabanan Shrine (also known as the War Arena Memorial, Spirit of Pinaglabanan, or Dambana ng Pinaglabanan) to commemorate the first battle of the 1896 Philippine Revolution, which occurred on that site on August 30, 1986, when the Katipuneros (Andres Bonifacio's revolutionary movement) laid siege to an arms storage facility known as the almacen de polvora, which belonged to the Spanish Colonial Government and the El Deposito..</P>
