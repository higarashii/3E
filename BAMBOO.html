      <h1> Bamboo Organ Church </h1>
    <p> The city's Bamboo Organ is a Philippine National Treasure, a very ancient but completely functional musical instrument made up of 1,031 pipes, 902 of which are bamboo. Spanish friar Diego Cera oversaw the Bamboo Organ's construction, which began in 1816 and was completed in 1824. The Bamboo Organ was damaged during a typhoon in 1880, but was completely repaired in 1972. Today, the Bamboo Organ is located at St. Joseph Parish Church, a historic church with Baroque architectural design and adobe stones. It is located at Padre Diego Cera Avenue, Barangay Daniel Fajardo, Las Piñas City, Metro Manila. <br> The church was dedicated to Saint Joseph, who is known locally as Tata Hosep. The antique image of Saint Joseph and the figure of dead Christ (Santo Sepulcro) were bought from San Dionisio, Parañaque for 2 dozen eggs. Saint Joseph Parish, like most old churches, has undergone numerous restorations. It was damaged by earthquakes several times in 1829.  Padre Diego Cera eventually renovated it. Many years later, an attempt was made to restore its appearance from the nineteenth century. Architect Francisco "Bobby" Mañosa and Ludwig Alvarez led the restoration from 1971 to 1975 under the supervision of Rev Fr. Mark Lesage. The only remaining pieces of the original church were the walls and the Bamboo Organ. The newly repaired church was opened on December 3, 1972. The basic framework was preserved, and complementary additions were made. It has capiz chandeliers, aged bricks, old statues, a bamboo ceiling, a choir loft with antique carved wood balustrades, and potted native palms.</P>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p> From Manila, you go to Baclaran. You can take the LRT or any other mode of transportation from your place to this location. This will be the point of origin for this trip. From the Baclaran MRT Station, you have to walk towards the Baclaran Church area. As you walk, you will see jeepneys with different signages. Now, be careful in getting a jeepney. Look for one that will have "ALABANG " in the windshield. Please also note NOT to take a jeepney with the signage "via Coastal" as this will require you to take another ride from Zapote to the Bamboo Organ - St. Joseph Church in Las Piñas. What you need to ride is the one that has "ALABANG" only or sometimes with the "via Quirino" signage and NOT "via COASTAL". To be sure, ask this with the driver. Ask if the jeepney will pass by the Bamboo Organ in St. Joseph Church. If it is, then you ride this jeepney. You only need to take this jeepney and get off in front of the St. Joseph Church where the Bamboo Organ is housed.
