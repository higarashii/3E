   <h1> Chinatown Binondo  </h1>
    <p>Offering a taste of China beyond the actual country, Binondo stands today as an iconic historical location holding the title of the oldest Chinatown in the world. If you’ve never heard of it or have and would like to know what the rustic district entails, then stay tuned as we’ll be unraveling the complete guide to the nostalgic side of Manila. It is located at Barangay 288 Binondo Chinatown,Manila,National Capital Region, Philippines<br>
<p style="font-size:17px;">Binondo was born 425 years ago as a result of Spanish colonization of the district and Philippines in general. The invading government took occupancy of the walled city of Intramuros just across the river from Binondo with the latter growing to be a popular trading hub for Chinese merchants. These traders, who were already doing commerce in the area even before the colonization, were granted the land in Binondo in perpetuity under the conditions of restricted self-governing roles and tax exemption. The ruling power, led by Governor Luis Pérez Dasmariñas, required Chinese immigrants to profess Catholicism in order to live in the town. As a result of the Chinese intermarrying with the indigenous, the region grew in both religion and Chinese heritage, resulting in the formation of the Chinese mestizo community and the world's first Chinatown in the Philippines.</P>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>There are several ways to reach this famous district. Probably the cheapest means, if you don’t mind crowds, is by taking the city trains. If you are traveling via LRT line 1, drop off at Carriedo station and if you are on LRT line 2, you should get off at Recto station. From either station, Binondo is only a 10 to 15-minute walk. Another more costly option is to take a cab or rent a car with a driver.<br>For starters, we do not recommend that you drive a car going there. Not only because of the narrow streets and limited parking areas but the real chinatown experience is on foot. Better yet, once you are in the area, you will find that the way to get around is by horse-driven carriages called “Calesas” as opposed to jeepneys and taxis.
