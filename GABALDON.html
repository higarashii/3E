Mingan – a breathtaking water fall that dominates the upper portion of the river, with unusually large and attractive boulders that adorn its banks and the river bed, plus lush vegetation of wild flowers, ferns, different varieties of trees along its banks and serves as habitat for diverse wild animals especially birds, lizards, butterflies and the like.
