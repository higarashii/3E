   <h1>Boracay Island</h1>
    <p>Boracay, one of the top Islands in the Philippines, is popular for its beaches and blessed with a long stretch of powdery white sand, crystal clear and azure waters, and a stunning sunset. You'll never run out of exciting things to do in Boracay, from swimming, island-hopping, diving, snorkeling, parasailing, and kayaking. It also has a fantastic nightlife scene, so there's something to enjoy at any hour of the day or night.
<p>Boracay is the most iconic island in the Philipines and has won multiple awards in previous years. In 2019, Boracay was the top of the Asia Category in Conde Nast Traveler's The Best Islands in the World 2019 Readers Choice Awards. In 2020, Boracay retains its Top 10 island status alongside other Philippine Islands as it places 6th in the Top 10 list.Boracay is a small island in the Philippines located at the Northwestern tip of Panay Island that belongs to the Malay municipality, province of Aklan found in Region VI. Only about 7 km long and 1 km wide, the island has over 300 resorts and hotels ranging from budget to upscale. There's a massive variety of dining choices, bars, and surprising attractions for any budget. Getting around is also easy and affordable, making it a fantastic, self-contained spot for the next beach holiday.
<p>The Atis first depended on fishing supplemented by coconut, cassava and potato plantations until the 1940's and 1950's on this small but beautiful island. Until a few decades ago, there was no electricity, nor was it known for its culture, art or architectural monuments. Then it was discovered by backpackers and popularized by a travel book published by the German writer Jens Peter that described Boracay's history and called it the most beautiful island in Asia. He took photos from all over the island and made postcards from them, which contributed to Boracay's development into a backpacker's hangout in the 1980's and eventually one of the major tourist destinations in the Philippines.</p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Boracay Island, you can follow these general directions:
<p>From Manila you can choose to travel to Boracay via either Kalibo Airport or Caticlan which is otherwise known as Boracay Airport. Caticlan is 30 minutes from Boracay so it's the most convenient option. Flights to Kalibo are usually a bit cheaper, but from Kalibo it takes about 2 hours to reach Boracay. Getting to Boracay from Caticlan Airport is relatively quick and painless. Your travel time will consist out of a 10 minute tricycle ride and a 15 minute boat ride. Getting to Boracay from Kalibo Airport takes about 2 hours. You can transfer via a van, a bus, a taxi or a helicopter. 
<p>Most people transfer via a van, but space in them is restricted, so it isn't a very comfortable ride. Getting from the Jetty Port in Boracay to your hotel will take about 30 minutes on average. How long it'll take exactly depends on the location of your hotel and the amount of traffic. Once you arrive in Boracay you'll see a line of tricycles to your right. You can choose to either take a private ride, or a join in ride if you're on a budge Unless you're on a super-tight budget the private ride is more suitable, because join in rides are usually not very comfortable due to limited space, plus they only travel along the main road, so if your hotel is not along the main road you'll have to walk that distance.</p>
