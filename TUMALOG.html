   <h1>Tumalog Falls</h1>
    <p>Tumalog Falls is located in the town of Oslob, Cebu, Philippines. It is roughly 170 kilometers from Cebu City, typically requiring a drive of about 3 to 4 hours depending on traffic conditions. Tumalog Falls is one of the natural attractions that make Oslob a popular destination, aside from its famous whale shark watching activities.<p>

<p>Tumalog Falls is known for its stunning beauty, characterized by its tall but gentle cascade over a wide, amphitheater-like formation covered with lush, mossy vegetation. The waterfalls create a thin, veil-like drizzle as they descend, which has a soothing, almost ethereal appearance. The pool at the bottom is shallow and clear, inviting visitors to wade and enjoy a refreshing dip.<p>

<p>The area surrounding the falls is relatively undeveloped, adding to its charm and the feeling of being close to nature. The approach to the falls requires a short walk from the parking area, which can be a bit steep, though motorbike services are available to take visitors closer to the site.<p>

<p>Tumalog Falls is particularly popular because it offers a serene and picturesque setting ideal for relaxation and nature photography. It's a must-visit for those traveling to Oslob, especially for those looking to unwind after an early morning of whale shark watching.</p>
