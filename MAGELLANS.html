   <h1> Magellan's Cross</h1>
    <p>   Magellan's Cross Pavilion is a stone kiosk in Cebu City, Philippines. The structure is situated on Plaza Sugbo beside the Basilica del Santo Niño. It holds a very big part of the history of Cebu. It is believed to be a Christian cross planted by the Portuguese and Spanish explorers headed by Ferdinand Magellan. It was planted upon their arrival in Cebu on March 15, 1521. That day also marked the birth of Christianity in the land. <p>

<p>The crucifix on show is said to contain remnants from a cross Magellan planted on the shores of Cebu in 1521. A painting on the ceiling of the rotunda shows Magellan erecting the cross (actually, the locals are doing all the work – Magellan's just standing around). After the Santo Niño, this is the most venerated religious relic in Cebu. Its history should be traced from the time of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta reported that when they arrived in Cebu, a cross was erected in order to manifest their intention that faith should be spread in the land. Pigafetta reported on the event of the baptism of Rajah Humabon, “A large cross was set up in themiddle of the square. The captain told them that if they wished to become Christians as they had declared on the previous days, that they must burn all their idols and set up a cross in their place.

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Magellan's Cross, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>you can start by heading to the city center, perhaps by taxi or public transportation. From there, navigate towards the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño, one of the oldest Roman Catholic churches in the country, as Magellan's Cross is located just a short walk away from it. Once you reach the basilica, you'll find Magellan's Cross housed in a small chapel right next to it.<p>
