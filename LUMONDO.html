   <h1>Lumondo Falls</h1>
    <p>Lumondo Falls is situated in Barangay Budlingin, Alegria, Surigao del Norte. Lumondo Falls is being dubbed as a Neglected Gem of Nature in Surigao del Norte. It is an amazing waterfalls in the province with around 20 meters drop. This falls is at its raw form, preserved and untouched.<p>

<p>Lumondo Falls is approximately 2.5kms from the national highway and 51.5 kms from the nearest airport(Surigao Domestic Airport). From the crossroad of the national highway along Brgy. Don Julio Ouano, Alegria, SDN, one can sport a ride with a habal-habal up to its Information  Center towering the nearby location of the actual water drop.<p>

<p>One can find huge boulders below the cascading waters. There are also plenty of flora and fauna and different species of birds. This is really 99% at its natural form with less or no improvements made. One have to trek on a mountain trail leading to the falls.<p>

<p>Visitors to Santiago City often find themselves drawn to the vibrant atmosphere of the plaza, whether it's to unwind after a day of exploring the city or to immerse themselves in the local culture and community spirit.<p>
