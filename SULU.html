   <h1>Sulu Provincial Capitol</h1>
    <p>The capitol is located near the Sulu State College and is Islam inspired, this is because of the fact that 97% of the population are Tausugs who embrace Islam as their religion.<p>

<p>Located at the heart of Jolo, the capital town of the province, the Sulu Provincial Capitol with its Moorish inspired architectural design and golden domes is considered as one of the most beautiful capitol buildings in the country.<p>

<p>The two-story building is a timeless legacy of the late Sulu Gov Murphy Sangkula. Further, it is composed of the main art deco concrete façade then topped off by an octagonal structure that ends in a gold-painted hemispherical dome.<p>

<p>Exploring the capitol building of Sulu almost brought me to another world. I felt like I was out of the Philippines. But I had to accept that beautiful magnificent structures like this really exist in our country.<p>

        <h2>Sulu Peacekeepers Inn</h2>
        <p><strong>Information:</strong> <p>Located in Camp Asturias, Jolo Philippines.<p>
<p>It boasts contemporary design and comfortable accommodations suitable for both leisure and business travelers.<p>
<p>You can't really expect a very extravagant accommodation so it's already a nice place to stay. Secured as it is inside a police camp. Pillows are a bit hard, sheets are thin BUT, rooms are typically nice. Aircon is perfectly working. CR is very good. Bidet is a plus factor! Although there's no hot shower but nevertheless, it's still decent and a very nice place to stay in Jolo. There's also a restaurant inside so that's a plus factor as well. Sari-sari store for your snacks or toiletries can be found just in front of the inn. Would recommend this place if you'll stay in Jolo.</p>
