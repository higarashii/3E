       <h1>Fort Santiago</h1>
    <p>Fort Santiago is strategically located at the mouth of the Pasig River, overlooking Manila Bay. Its location allowed it to control access to the city and served as a key defensive structure against foreign invasions. Fort Santiago was built in the late 16th century during the Spanish colonial period. It served as a military defense fortress and was the headquarters of the Spanish conquistador, Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi, the first Governor-General of the Philippines. It is located at HXVC+M5V, Intramuros, Manila, 1002 Metro Manila.</p>

<p>Fort Santiago is one of the oldest fortifications in Manila built by the Spaniards in 1571 from what was once a palisaded structure of logs and earth built by Rajah Soliman on the native settlement called Maynila. The colonizers recognized that the tongue of land where the Pasig River flowed into the Manila Bay was a very strategic location. </p>

<p>The fort was destroyed in 1574 during the Chinese attack led by Limahong. The stone fort was built between 1589 and 1592 and was repaired and extended after being damaged by the 1645 earthquake. Spanish, British, American and Japanese occupation forces used the fort as their headquarters and a prison for men, women, children and soldiers. After its destruction during the Battle of Manila in 1945, the fort was used by the U.S. Transportation Corps as a depot until it was turned over to the Philippine government in 1946. In 1950, Fort Santiago was declared a Shrine of Freedom and restoration began the following year. Today, it stands as a memorial to the victims of World War II and the sacrifices of the Filipino people in pursuit of freedom.</p>

 <h1>How to Get there</h1>


<p>1. Look for jeepneys with routes passing through Intramuros or designated Intramuros jeepneys. Ask the driver to drop you off at Fort Santiago</p>
<p>2. If you're coming from areas serviced by the LRT-1, such as Baclaran or Monumento, you can ride the train and disembark at the Central Terminal Station. From there, you can walk or take a short jeepney ride to Fort Santiago.</p>
