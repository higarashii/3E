   <h1>Lussok Caves, Apayao</h1>
    <p> Dagupan, Luna, Apayao, Philippines<p>
    <p>Lussok cave and underground river is now one of the biggest eco-tourism sites in Luna, Apayao, the last forest frontier in the Cordilleras. The adventure in Lussok Cave, which means “to come into” (Catajan, 2017), has two parts: going through the underground river by boat and exploring the cave on foot.<p>

<p>Visiting the site starts by exploring the underground river via boat. Only about a hundred meters of the underground river is accessible (Abille, 2016). A boat ride is necessary unlike other nearby caves with subterranean rivers such as the Aran cave in Tuba, Longog cave in Kapangan, Diadyan cave in Quirino Province, San Carlos cave in Cagayan Valley, and Capisaan Cave in Nueva Vizcaya.<p>

<p>Throughout the boat ride in the underground river, rock formations will totally astound you with colorful rock formations. Unlike to its counterpart in Palawan, at the end of the boat ride, you can explore the different chambers of the cave on foot. In total, the boat ride through the river and spelunking in the cave boasts around 200 meter journey (Catajan, 2017)
Stalactites and stalagmites are also abundant inside the cave. Rock formations of different forms will usually be highlighted by your guide.<p>
