   <h1> Canhugas Nature Park</h1>
    <p>An impressive spectacle! Gigantic waves crushing onto large rock formations mark this place as an extraordinary tourist destination. Climbing up the walls of these hefty rocks will give you a phenomenal setting, a beautiful backdrop. Don’t forget to bring your HD cameras as photography could be one of great deals here

<p>Fresh from the sea! Just in every rock formation is a natural-made pool. Water comes from the strong ocean waves hammering the rocks, flowing to the pool terraces.

<p>Salty blue falls! Sturdy waves create waterfalls which flow into a deep hole where waves also came crushing through, crafting a view of natural features that is ‘bluish-ly exquisite.’
