   <h1>Canaan Hill Farms</h1>
    <p>Canaan Hill Farms is an agri-tourism farm site accredited by the Department of Tourism and TESDA that promotes tourism and agriculture. The farm is located in the town of Caibiran, Biliran which also provides agriculture-related training in the Eastern Visayas region.</p>

<p>The farm is owned and run by the Espinazo Family from the patriarchs to their grandchildren. The name came from the Bible which we all know as the land of milk and honey. The management is very conservative and there are strict rules to be followed by guests. The farm is 7 hectares and has an elevated terrain that rises up to 350 ft above sea level. It is an organic farm that grows its crops naturally meaning no pesticides, insecticides, and zero percent chemicals.</p>

<p>They also raise goats, wild pigs, free-range chickens, doves, and sheep. These livestock’s waste is to be fed to worms that produce a vermicast which they use as the fertilizer for their crops. They focus on fruits, vegetables, and herbs production which they sell in the market and in their pharmacy. These produce can be used for culinary and health purposes.</p>
