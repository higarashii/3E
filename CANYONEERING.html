   <h1>Canyoneering Badian</h1>
    <p>Badian is located in the south west of Cebu, a popular island in the central Visayas of the Philippines. Badian Canyoneering in Cebu is an outdoor recreational activity that mainly involves traveling through canyons by various methods such as hiking, walking, rappelling, jumping, swimming, and rock climbing.<p>
        
   </p> canyoneering in the municipality of Badian has two options. First one is the downstream canyoneering. This will start from the Kanlaob River in Alegria going through Badian and ending in Kawasan Falls.<p>

<p>The second one is the upstream canyoneering that simply reverses the downstream route. The starting point of the upstream canyoneering is in the Ka

    <h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Canyoneering Badian, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>Canyoneering is a sport of exploring canyons through rappelling, hiking, swimming, and jumping. This will need your stamina, strength and most of all your taste for adventure:<p>

<p>Badian, Cebu is not very far from Mactan Cebu International Airport. Badian is 3-3.5 hours by Bus and is located in the south. There is no problem travelling in Cebu because the highway is next to the beach. You will enjoy the scenery since on one side is the beach, and the other side are the mountains.<p>
<p>In order to reach Badian, take a 45 minute – 1 hour cab ride from Mactan Cebu International Airport to Cebu South Bus Terminal for 230.00-250.00php. From Mactan, you will pass Mandaue City and will enter Cebu City. Mactan, Manadue City and Cebu City looks exactly like Metro Manila. When you visit this place, you have to ready yourself when communicating with the locals.<p>

<p>when you arrive at the bus terminal, look for Ceres Liner with the card sign Bato via Barili. Do not ride Bato via Oslob because obviously, it will take you to Bato passing by Oslob. They have an hourly trip and the last trip is 10pm. If you arrive at the terminal at a very late hour, you have to brace yourself because people will be fighting for their seats.<p>
<p>It's recommended to verify the specific routes and transportation options based on your starting point and current travel conditions. Additionally, always exercise caution and follow local traffic regulations while traveling.<p>
