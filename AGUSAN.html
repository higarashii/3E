   <h1>AGUSAN MARSH WILDLIFE SANCTUARY</h1>
    <p>Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected inland wetland area characterized by intricate ecosystems of freshwater swamp forests, marshes, complex watercourses, and an array of shallow lakes and ponds, all situated at the heart of the Agusan River Basinâ€”the third longest river basin in the Philippines. Agusan Marsh is also host to "Wonderland", where you can see natural "bonsai" trees crafted by nature. It can be reached from Barangay Caimpogan or from Barangay New Visayas in the municipality of San Francisco.<p>

<p>It is located in the municipalities of Bunawan, La Paz, Loreto, Rosario, San Francisco, Talacogon, and Veruela in the province of Agusan del Sur.  The marshland acts like a sponge, as it is nestled in the midwaters of the Agusan River drainage basin. Within its lakes, several floating communities can be found. The sanctuary was home to the 20.24 feet (6.17 m) saltwater crocodile Lolong, the world's largest captive crocodile.<p>

<p>Agusan Marsh is one of the largest and the most contained freshwater catch basin wetland in the Philippines which covers roughly almost the size of Metro Manila. It covers an area of 14,835.989 hectares and is home of different wildlife animals. It is a shutter haven for the wild bird photographers coz there you can see various species of wild birds such as Wild ducks, Herons, Egrets, Kingfisher finding shelter during the cold season of northern continents.<p>

<p>Entering the Marsh is like entering into a magical world. It was like a piece of heaven within the earth. So calm, so enchanting. The sound of silence was hypnotic. All you can hear was the earth's breathing through the gentle winds, rhyming the chirping of the birds while enjoying their wild abode. Ahh! It's like a music to my soul. That exact moment was the most relaxing voyage of my existence.<p>
