        <h2>Playa del Rosario</h2>
        <p><strong>Information:</strong> 
    <p>Playa del Rosario is a small beach resort tucked along the east coast municipality of Baganga.  Admittedly a long drive from Davao City, the resort can be reached by passing through Mati City (290 kilometers or 5.5 hour-drive) or via Compostela (220 kilometers or 4 hour-drive).  You will be accompanied by a long stretch of seaside scenery or be treated to a meandering trip past hills and ridges.</p> 
<p>Baganga is a first-class municipality in Davao Oriental.  Life is still laid-back – no traffic, fewer stores, limited dining options – and the locality hums to quietude by nightfall.  However, what it lacks in modern conveniences, the municipality makes up for having several water-based attractions such Campawan and the nearby Aliwagwag Falls, San Victor Island, the Carolina lake, a sand bar, and even a hot spring.</p>  
<p>You can visit these natural spots going to or after leaving Baganga – and we would be happy to have you spend the night at Playa del Rosario Resort.  We offer 14 rooms, configured to cater to groups of 4, 8, or 14 persons. These rooms are modestly decked with minimum amenities that will still afford you a comfortable stay.</p>
