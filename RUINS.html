   <h1>Ruins of Alcatraz</h1>
    <p> Known as the "Seafood Capital of the Philippines," Capiz is a province in the northeastern region of Panay Island that is home to several historical sites, beaches, and caverns in addition to its mouthwatering fresh seafood.
<p>Located in Barangay Culasi, Sitio Nipa, Roxas City, the Ruins of Alcatraz are an incomplete, abandoned resort owned by the Bermejo Family. The ruins are quite lovely and distinctive. This may be a set for a movie scene or possibly a prenuptial agreement for creative thinkers.
<p>According to the local community, the idea was to develop this location as a resort, featuring an oceanfront infinity pool below and a restaurant on top. However, they halted work due to Super Typhoon Yolanda and eventually abandoned it. The location is still unfinished after years have gone, but its beauty has not diminished. The location is stunning by nature, especially considering that it is on a hill and faces Roxas' beach. The area is referred to as Alcatraz ni Bermejo, or the ruins, in the local tongue. Because of its resemblance to the notorious island jail in the United States, it is sometimes occasionally referred to as Alcatraz or the Ruins of Alcatraz. </p>
