   <h1>Baras Cave</h1>
    <p>One interesting place that visitors usually skip is a small cave named Baras in Brgy. Lawi in the Municipality of Jordan. Baras Cave is a small cave with two openings. One can practically swim from one entrance to the other. The water is quite deep, while its reflection on the interior of the cave creates a mesmerizing effect. Small cave with double entry for a short break visiting the charming islands of Guimaras. Nice for swimming, break from the sun and talking some photos. 
<p>Baras Cave is one of the stops at the Islang Hopping in Guimaras arranged by the Raymen Beach Resort. It is a spacious cave with different rock formations already. It is possible and safe to go deeper inside but better with a guide. Guimaras has a number of caves that tourists can explore, all of them varying in accessibility and size. 
<p>The most visited is the Baras Cave, which houses fruit bats. Other caves, such as Biri Cave and Bucoy Cave - both in Jordan - can only be accessed by crawling. Capitoguan Cave, also in Jordan, is a bat sanctuary and is about 250 meters (820 feet) long and the entrance is 12 meters (39 feet) tall. Higante Cave, found on top of a hill in Jordan, was said to have been inhabited by a giant, hence its name.</p>
