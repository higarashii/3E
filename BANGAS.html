<p>It boasts contemporary design and comfortable accommodations suitable for both leisure and business travelers.<p>
<p>You can't really expect a very extravagant accommodation so it's already a nice place to stay. Secured as it is inside a police camp. Pillows are a bit hard, sheets are thin BUT, rooms are typically nice. Aircon is perfectly working. CR is very good. Bidet is a plus factor! Although there's no hot shower but nevertheless, it's still decent and a very nice place to stay in Jolo. There's also a restaurant inside so that's a plus factor as well. Sari-sari store for your snacks or toiletries can be found just in front of the inn. Would recommend this place if you'll stay in Jolo.</p>
