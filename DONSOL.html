Here tourists can interact with whale sharks (butanding in local parlance) by snorkeling, diving, or by simply waiting for them in areas where they come right up to the surface. Donsol has been recognized as the “Whale Shark Capital of the World”. <p>

<p>These gentle giants cruise Donsol waters because their primary food sources, plankton and algae, are abundant in Donsol River, which feeds into Donsol Bay. As of 2023, the World Wildlife Fund - Donsol has identified 43 individual whale sharks that have visited its waters, 16 of which are newcomers to Donsol. Tourists also have to abide by strict rules to ensure that the whale sharks would not be harmed, such as not having more than 6 swimmers per shark, a limited number of boats in the area, a ban on scuba diving in the area, and no feeding of sharks in any way.<p>
