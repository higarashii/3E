   <h1>Tarlac Reacreational Park</h1>
    <p>
While thinking of a fun place where my office mates will enjoy, Tarlac came across the picture. It seemed to be the perfect setting where we can bond at low cost. 
<p>

<p>
First, we went to Tarlac Recreational Park to enjoy some thrilling adventures. The brave hearted ones immediately tried the dune buggy drive which costs 300 pesos per 20-minute-ride. <p>

<p>There was adrenaline rush as I competed with the boys in our office. It was like drive a small automatic car driven in a rocky road. We were all dusty yet giddy as we drove around the 78 hectare recreational park. <p>

<p>I totally enjoyed the dune buggy and I attested the fun by riding it for three consecutive times. The last one was with my sister who was celebrating her masteral degree at that time. She was so afraid that she might fall but I assured her that I was already expert by memorizing the track of the dune buggy. At the end, we both made this experience a very notable one. <p>
