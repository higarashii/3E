   <h1>Aliguay Island</h1>
    <p>Aliguay is an island in the Philippines, and a barangay of Dapitan. The island is an established marine sanctuary. The island is surrounded by white sand beaches and coral reefs. There are no water sources on the island. A few residents live on Aliguay Island, mostly selling fish to tourists.<p>

<p>Aliguay is a small island located about an hour away by speed boat from Dakak Beach Resort in Dapitan. Due to its remote location, only few tourists are able to visit this wonderful island. <p>
<p>The Aliguay Island Protected Landscape and Seascape is regarded as one of the undiscovered gems of Zamboanga. Surrounded by pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and coral reefs, this marine sanctuary has been in place for a while. Because of this, the majority of visitors to this isolated island use snorkels to view Aliguay's underwater wonders. The island is less commercialized, yet the residents welcome visitors and offer simple amenities and meals.<p>
<p>Though most past tourists have arrived at Aliguay by arranging rides with the local boatmen and fishermen at Dipolog and Dapitan, there isn't a set route to get to the island. Approximately Php3,000 is needed for a round-trip boat ride.<p>
