<p>This monument was built in the province of Tarlac to honor the brave men and women who defied the might of the invaders at Bataan during World War II. Along with this, its location is where the infamous 97-kilometer march or the Bataan Death March ended.  <p>

<p>The center of attraction in the whole shrine is the black obelisk, but it is not your basic four-cornered obelisks; it is segmented into three posts that meet at the top. Surrounding the obelisk are three walls or the “Wall of Heroes Memorial,” engraved on these walls are some of the names of identified Filipino soldiers who died during the march.<p>
