   <h1>KAYANGAN LAKE</h1>
    <p>Kayangan Lake is the ancestral domain of the indigenous Tagbanua people who call Coron home. It’s important to note that the lake has a long history of local lore and tradition behind it, and increasing tourist numbers have seen the boundaries between the Tagbanua and tourists pushed to the limits. The Tagbanua are the original inhabitants of Coron, a community descended from the Tabon culture which is seen as the first modern human culture to arrive in the Philippines. Tagbanua traditions mean that they see themselves as caretakers of their sacred land, including the lakes, as well as guardians of the visitors who come here. Ancient traditions hold that the lakes on Coron Island, of which Kayangan is but one that’s open to tourists, are home to nature spirits. This includes the riveting myth of a giant octopus creature that defends the land of the Tagbanua. Kayangan Lake is a crystal-clear freshwater lake in Coron, featuring underwater rock formations, caves and islets. It's a popular spot for photographers, for fairly obvious reasons, and is said to be the cleanest lake in all of the Philippines.</p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
Kayangan Lake is only accessible by boat, and it’s a short 15 minutes journey from Coron town (or 5 minutes from the stunning Twin Lagoon). Most people choose one of the package tours to see this beautiful place, many of which arrive at the same time. By hiring your own boat, you’ll be able to magically skip all the crowds and have a fantastic experience (more on that later). There are no public transport options to visit Kayangan. With either option the boat will dock at the pier in the middle of this stunning bay. If you go on a package tour, you will go to Kayangan Lake at exactly the same time as all the other groups. Tour companies in Coron are unimaginative and all stick to very similar timetables, so you’ll bump into the same people all day. This means you’ll be going to every spot at the most crowded times of day.</p>
