   <h1>Tinago Waterfalls</h1>
    <p>The most hypnotic waterfalls magnificently lay its beauty in the heart of Caibiran rainforest, a loop trail taking 10 minutes from the highway. A hideaway that blends perfectly for nature lovers; rich blend of trees, vines, & other exotic plants accompanied by the cooling & enchanting sounds of rushing streams. Tucked in the forest of Caibiran, near the heart of the island, the falls (Tinago in English means hidden) is no longer hidden, and is probably the most popular falls in the province.</p>

<p>During the old times, the road leading to the Tinago falls was dusty and wearisome, posing as a challenge to visitors, thus, the name Tinago (meaning hidden).  Today, emerging as one of the top tourist attractions of the province of Biliran, concrete pavements and farm to market roads have greatly been developed, making the said destination accessible to all.</p>

<p>The lush green rainforest, boulders, playful locals and the stunning waterfalls surround the cold pool of water. Despite the gloomy weather at Tacloban City, the province of Biliran provided us a perfect summer getaway and a refreshment from the too hot temperature of Metro Manila.  As soon as we arrived at the Tinago Falls Leisure Park, we all took a dip and immersed on the cold waters of the falls.</p>
