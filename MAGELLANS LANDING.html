     <h1> Magellan’s Landing Site </h1>
    <p> Magellan’s Landing Site in Agusan del Norte is a historical landmark that commemorates the arrival of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the Philippines. Situated at the mouth of the Masao River, this site is believed to be where Magellan and his crew set foot on Philippine soil during their circumnavigation of the globe in 1521. A statue and several markers now stand at this location, serving as a reminder of this significant event in the country’s history. The site is not only a testament to the beginning of Christianity in the Philippines but also marks the first recorded instance of international relations and diplomacy between Europe and the Philippines. <br>

Today, Magellan’s Landing Site is a place of reflection and education for visitors and locals alike. While the beach itself may be modest and somewhat unadorned, the historical value of the site provides a deep sense of connection to the past. It is a poignant spot for those interested in the rich tapestry of Philippine history and the global impact of the Age of Exploration. The site’s location near the entrance to the Masao River makes it easily accessible for those looking to delve into the historical narratives that have shaped the nation</p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>Look for a tricycle near the PNP Hospital (across the Libertad Fruit Vendors Association market).<BR>
Find the sign that says “Barangay Ambago” at the corner of this street and the main J.C. Aquino Ave.<BR>
For a fee ranging from PHP 200 to PHP 300, the tricycle can take you to visit the Balangay Shrine Museum, Magellan’s Landing Site, and the Bood Promontory Eco Park. The fee usually includes the trip back to the main avenue
