   <h1>Dambana ng Kagitingan (Shrine of Valor)</h1>
    <p>The Shrine of Valor is situated atop Mount Samat, a strategic vantage point overlooking the Bataan Peninsula and Manila Bay. Mount Samat is approximately 20 kilometers from the town of Balanga, the capital of Bataan Province, and is easily accessible by car or public transportation.<p>

<p>The Shrine of Valor commemorates the heroism and sacrifices of Filipino and American soldiers who fought during the Battle of Bataan in World War II. The battle, which took place from January to April 1942, marked a significant chapter in Philippine history and is remembered for the courage and resilience of the defenders against overwhelming odds.<p>

<p>At the heart of the shrine complex is a towering cross, standing at 92 meters tall, symbolizing the Filipinos' faith and courage during the war. The cross serves as a memorial to the soldiers who perished during the battle and is visible from miles around.<p>

<p>Adjacent to the cross is a museum that showcases artifacts, photographs, and memorabilia related to the Battle of Bataan and World War II. Visitors can learn about the events leading up to the battle, the experiences of soldiers and civilians during the war, and the significance of the shrine in Philippine history.</p>
