	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Natago Beach, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>1. There are no direct flights from Manila to Guimaras; however, the island is easy to get to from Iloilo City. There are direct and regular flights operated by Cebu Pacific Air and Philippine Airlines.
Tourists' route of choice to Guimaras is via Ortiz Wharf where boats bound for Jordan Wharf in Guimaras run regularly. The fastest way to get to the wharf from Iloilo's city center is by taxi. This is the port of choice because it only takes around 15 minutes to the island; the fare is approximately ₱15 as of this writing.<p>
<p>2. Once in Jordan Wharf, visitors have to register at the tourism office where they can also board tricycles to take them around or straight to their chosen accommodations. A one way trip to Alubihod Beach, Nueva Valencia is around ₱250. This is also the area where most resorts are located. Natago Beach is part of the island hopping tour most visitors do from Alubihod Beach.</p>
