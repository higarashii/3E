   <h1>Canigao Island</h1>
    <p>The white sand beach on sunny Canigao Island is a local favourite. With palm trees lining the coast and clean blue waters, the small island looks as good in person as it does in pictures. Beach bummers can relax and sunbathe on the powdery shore, while more adventurous travellers can explore underwater gems by scuba diving and snorkelling around the island. Don’t miss visiting one of Leyte’s oldest lighthouses right in the heart of Canigao Island.<p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>Take a van from Tacloban to Maasin, and ask the driver to drop you off at Matalom. Upon getting to Matalom, walk or ride a tricycle to the pier, where boats will be waiting to take you to Canigao Island. Expect a 20-minute boat ride to the island.<p>
