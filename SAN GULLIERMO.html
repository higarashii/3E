   <h1>San Guillermo Parish Church</h1>
    <p> San Guillermo Parish Church is a historic Catholic church located in Bacolor, Pampanga, Philippines. The church was originally built in the 16th century during the Spanish colonial period and is one of the oldest churches in the province. It is named after St. William the Hermit, the town's patron saint. The church's architectural style is typical of Spanish-era churches, with a Baroque design characterized by thick walls, large wooden doors, and intricate religious art.<p>

<p> San Guillermo Parish Church is particularly famous for its resilience following the devastating eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption caused massive lahar flows, burying a significant portion of the church, leaving only the upper third visible. Despite this, the church continued to function, with the community adapting by using the elevated portion for services and other religious activities. Today, visitors to the church can witness its unique structure and explore the museum dedicated to the town's history and the impact of the eruption, making it an important landmark that symbolizes the spirit and perseverance of the Bacolor community. <p>
