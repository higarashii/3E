   <h1>Sungkilaw Falls</h1>
    <p>Sungkilaw Falls is an amazing sight that many local and foreign tourists really love to visit and explore. It is described as an entirely new whitewater experience where the sightseeing pleasure never wanes.  It lies beneath the mountains of Diwan, Dipolog City. It boasts a spring on the east part that flows to a very rapid fall down to a river. Visiting this attraction will allow tourists to view one of the most beautiful sight in Diwan. A view deck has been constructed to allow visitors to observe the white foamy water of the falls as it cascades through a formation of large rocks. It's a magnificent sight that will make one appreciate the beauty of nature. It's also a good spot to take a few scenic photographs. The view deck is around 30 meters away so your sensitive cameras will be safe from the splashing and spraying water. <p>

<p>Folks who want to get wet and enjoy the water can take a dip at the nearby spring. This is the main swimming area for tourists and the spring has a current that flows directly into the waterfall. There are plenty of large rocks around which makes it a scenic swimming spot. But I do have to warn you to be prepared because the water is very cold.<p>
<p>A small detour on the trail to the majestic Sungkilaw Falls will bring visitors to a well with water that have high concentration of salts and minerals. The fascinating water of this well is said to have therapeutic properties so it might be the cure to some of your aches and pains.<p>
