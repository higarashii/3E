   <h1>Samar Archaeological Museum</h1>
    <p>The Samar Archeological Museum, the only archeological museum in Eastern Visayas found at Christ the King College, celebrated its golden anniversary on August 29 with a tribute to the priest who started it all—Franciscan priest Fr. Cantius J. Kobak, OFM.</p>

<p>The Samar Archeological Museum was established in 1969 by Fr. Cantius Kobak, a Polish missionary assigned to the Philippines who saw the lack of public awareness about Samar’s history and culture. Since opening to the public in 1970, the museum has been able to preserve the island’s cultural treasures and expose younger generations to histories past. Artifacts of early Samarnon life include knives, arrow heads, and bowls. As in most museums, the Samar Archeological Museum deals not just with life but with death, too. Aside from the burial jars and wooden coffins, a highlight of the tour is getting to see the remains of early Samarnons.</p>

<p>The museum is one of the vital contributions of Christ the King College in preserving the rich cultural heritage of the Filipino people.  A collection of many artefacts gathered from all points of Samar Island, the museum also houses ancient coins, jars, Chinawares, bracelets and beads that date back to as early as the 14th century.</p>
