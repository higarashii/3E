   <h1>QUEEN TUNA PARK</h1>
   
    <p>Formerly known as Lion’s Beach, the Queen Tuna Park in General Santos is probably one of the less-maintained parks in the Philippines. Though, it is regularly visited by locals and domestic tourists because of the large waves coming from the Celebes Sea and the nice breeze and cool air which can be experienced in the place.</p>

<p>Queen Tuna Park is located in Barangay Dadiangas South, nearby the Old Mosque and Public Market. The authorities invested a lot of money to beautify this place so it can add to the tourist attractions in the city – but because of the current security issues in Basilan, the tourism of the whole Mindanao Island was affected.</p>

<p>The Queen Tuna Park is open to the public from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm. Bathing of pets is not allowed. Selling & bringing of alcoholic drinks, gambling, littering, parking of vehicles and smoking are strictly prohibited. Cooking is allowed in designated areas only. The use of cottages inside Queen Tuna Park is free but make sure to keep it clean and orderly when you leave.</p>

<p>Large concrete statues of animals such as elephants, fishes and dinosaurs can be seen inside the Queen Tuna Park. But because of the problems in tourism, there’s no budget allocated for it yet. I’m positive that the government will soon improve the park so it can invite more tourists.</p>

<h1>How to get there:</h1>

<p>Queen Tuna Park is about 14 kilometers from the General Santos International Airport. Hire a habal-habal (P120) or taxi (P300) going directly to the place. In the city center, any tricycle (P10) can bring you to the park.</p>
