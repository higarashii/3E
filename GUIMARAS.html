   <h1>Guimaras Island</h1>
    <p> Guimaras, officially the Province of Guimaras, is an island province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. The capital is Jordan, while the largest local government unit for it is the municipality of Buenavista. The province is situated in Panay Gulf, between the islands of Panay and Negros.
<p>Guimaras is an island province surrounded by body of water in which the largest is the Guimaras Strait on the western side of the island. It is the most important water body used for navigation. Large and small boats going in and out of the provinces of Iloilo and Guimaras pass Guimaras Strait which makes it an important economic driver that facilitates economic activities for both provinces.
<p>It was originally known as "Himal-us," but following the folktale of the unfortunate lovers, Princess Guima and the slave Aras, who defied convention with their romance, it was renamed "Guimaras." The island was formerly an Iloilo subprovince, but thanks to R.A. 7160 On May 22, 1992, it was declared a regular province.</p>
