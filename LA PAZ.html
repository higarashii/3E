 <h1>The La Paz Sand Dunes
</h1>
    <p>La Paz, Laoag, Luzon, Philippines<p>
    <p>The La Paz Sand Dunes Most famous for its sand dunes, the Sand Dunes is one of the most visited tourist spots in Laoag. This area is estimated to be 85 square kilometers long coastal beach and desert area.<p>

<p> Laoag Sand Dunes goes by the name of Bantay Bimmaboy because of its shape which resembles that of pigs. Aside from that, it is also called the Desert of the North because of its popularity when it comes to shooting locations for famous films both inside and outside the country. The sand dunes are found in the coastal village of Barangay La Paz, which lends the site its name. The Laoag Sand Dunes forms a part of the Ilocos Norte Sand Dunes (INSD), which stretches from the town of Currimao, north of Laoag, to Pasuquin, south of Laoag. The INSD was identified as one of the National Geological Monuments or significant geological formations in the Philippines by the National Committee on Geological Sciences (NCGS) on November 26, 1993.<p>

<p>  A marker erected by the NCGS in Barangay Calayab in Laoag City gives recognition to the uniqueness of the desert environment in the Philippines and its scientific and educational value. The sand dunes of Ilocos were created by the interaction of the wind, sea, and river that together cause erosion and deposition. The size of the dunes varies depending on a number of factors, including the currents, weather conditions, nature of winds, amount of sediment, and type of vegetation in the area. The dunes that directly face the coast of the South China Sea are not as old as the others and tend to be more volatile. Sand dunes in some of the more sheltered areas of the INSD can reach as high as 90 meters.<p>
