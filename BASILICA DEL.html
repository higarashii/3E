   <h1>Basilica del Santo Niño </h1>
    <p>  The Minor Basilica of the Holy Child, locally known as the Basílica Minore del Santo Niño de Cebú and commonly known as Santo Niño Basilica, is a minor basilica in Cebu City in the Philippines that was founded in 1565 by Fray Andrés de Urdaneta and Fray Diego de Herrera. It is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the country, allegedly built on the spot where the image of the Santo Niño de Cebú was found during the expedition of Miguel López de Legazpi. The church houses the image of the Sto. Niño, the city’s patron saint that represents Jesus as a black Holy Child. It is also a place for prayer and pilgrimage to a large number of people each year.<p>

<p> The present building was completed in 1740 and was designated by the Holy See as the "Mother and Head of all Churches in the Philippines". It is under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Cebu and the Augustinian Province of Santo Niño de Cebu. The first church to be built on the site where the image of the Holy Child was found was burned down on November 1, 1566. It was said to be built by Fr. Diego de Herrera using wood and nipa. Fray Pedro Torres, O.S.A. started the construction of a new church in 1605. It was finished in 1626 but was again burned in March 1628. Fray Juan Medina, O.S.A. started the construction of another church that year, using stone and bricks, a great innovation at that time. Construction was stopped because the structure was found to be defective.
