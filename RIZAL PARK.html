   <h1> Rizal Park  </h1>
    <p> Rizal Park, widely known as Luneta Park is an iconic park that carries with it a rich history, as it is the location where the country’s National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal was executed. The park was also formerly known as Bagumbayan during the Spanish Occupation in the Philippines.It is located at Roxas Blvd 1000 Manila Luzon. <br>
Rizal Park is one of Asia's largest leisure parks. The 58-hectare park is located in the northern section of Roxas Boulevard. It is bounded by Taft, Padre Burgos, and Kalaw avenues. Aside from Rizal Park, nearby attractions include the National Museum, National Museum of Anthropology, Manila Ocean Park, Intramuros, and many others. In addition to a walk through the park, you can take a photograph with the iconic Rizal monument, which is the country's most visited and photographed statue of all time. Because it is a historical monument, you can also visit the actual location where Dr. Rizal was executed, which is roughly a hundred meters away from the Rizal statue. Along with these activities, there are other landmarks worth visiting, such as the massive Lapu-Lapu statue and the Gallery of Heroes, which houses statues of national heroes.You may also witness the largest flagpole in the country, and be astounded by the portrayal of the Philippine Archipelago through its massive map.</P>
