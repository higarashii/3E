   <h1>Daku Island, Siargao</h1>
<p>Daku is a barangay in the municipality of General Luna, in the province of Surigao del Norte. Enjoy the tropical charm of Daku Island, the largest among the three popular island destinations in Siargao. With a total land area of 136 hectares, Daku boasts a wide and quiet shoreline, picture-perfect coconut and palm trees on white sand, and just a few villagers.<p>

<p>Daku is one of the three islands that make up the standard island-hopping tours in Siargao. It is a mere 15-minute boat ride from General Luna, the central hub for Siargao's accommodations and surfing meets. You can easily book such a tour from your accommodation in General Luna, but this is generally more costly than renting a boat from the jetty.<p>

<p>Daku is, indeed, a relaxing beach for days with and without swell. On calm days, snorkeling is a must-do, more so with the clear electric-blue water. On bigger days, the Daku Reef creates a fun wave that is still more forgiving for surfers, as it’s not shallow like most breaks on Siargao.<p>

<p>This is the place where everyone taking the tri island hopping tour have their lunch. One of the islands that offers cooking services. This island has a surfing spot around the corner.<p>

    <h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Daku Island, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>Daku is situated at approximately 9.7418, 126.1575. Elevation at these coordinates is estimated at 14.9 meters or 48.9 feet above mean sea level. Daku Island is the largest and most popular island to visit during a day of Siargao island hopping. The easiest way to visit Daku Island is with a tour.<p>

<p>These island-hopping tours usually make the same circuit and stop at Daku Island, along with Naked Island and Guyam Island. If you prefer to tour the islands on your own, it’s also possible to hire a private boat. However, it’s recommended that you still make the same stopovers at Naked Island and Guyam Island. Due to their proximity to Daku, it would be a shame to miss out on these two beautiful islands!<p>
