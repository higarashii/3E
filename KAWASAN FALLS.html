   <h1> Kawasan Falls</h1>
    <p>    Kawasan falls Cebu is a peaceful natural place where you can enjoy many waterfalls of natural spring water located near the southern tip of Cebu Philippines. Kawasan has many waterfalls. The first one is the largest of the three and is usually the most crowded. An uphill climb for fifteen minutes will take you to the second waterfall, and another, and another. Famous for its beautiful turquoise water, Kawasan Falls sits at the foot of Mantalongon Mountain Range, approximately one kilometer from the national road of Badian and at least four hours of trekking from Osmeña Peak of Dalaguete. <p>

<p> Its cold and clear water cascades through layers of waterfalls emanating from Kandayvic Spring before going to Matutinao River and the Tañon Strait. The waterfall system consists of two main cascades both with deep natural pools ideal for swimming. The first cascade stands at approximately 40 meters while the less crowded second level has a height of approximately 20 meters and can be reached within ten minutes of trekking. The magical landscape of the falls is very cool and refreshing, an ideal paradise to anyone who loves and want to get intimate with nature. Enjoy the cold swim in the fresh, crystal clear spring water of these great water falls.
