   <h1> Tarsier Conservation Area</h1>
    <p>The Tarsier Conservation Area is a sanctuary in Loboc, Bohol. It is a 6-hectare facility that was established in 2011. The conservation area is a move to decongest the once 3-hectare facility into a larger one, where the Tarsiers caught as pet and domesticated by private individuals in Bohol was transferred into a more “natural” habitat. The Tarsier Conservation Area is one of several tarsier sanctuaries in Bohol that ensure the preservation of this endangered creature.<p>

<p>The Tarsier Conservation Area is a sanctuary in Loboc its located at Loay Interior Rd 6316 Loboc Central Visayas Bohol where you can have a close encounter with the tarsiers and learn more about their nature. This endangered creature is one of the iconic symbols of Bohol. The province has several tarsier sanctuaries to ensure their preservation.The Philippine Tarsier is considered as one of the smallest primates in the world. Unfortunately, it already belongs to, The World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates. The main reasons are its vulnerability and the absence of law protecting it from hunters in the past.<p>

<p>The moment we entered the sanctuary, we were guided to the briefing area.  The short briefing is about the sanctuary’s policies and guidelines on how to properly interact with the tarsiers. What we learned here is that the tarsier is a nocturnal type of animal which feeds on insects, lizards and small birds.<p>

<p>This creature is so delicate to the point that it will commit suicide when it gets too much stress. You can’t place it inside a cage because it will continuously bump its head to the metal bars until it dies.  These tiny critters may look sluggish and weak during the day but they are like Master Yoda at night. They can do very large hops (forty times their size) to catch the insects and are very swift to evade predators.<p>

<p>If you’re planning to visit Bohol, we highly recommend visiting the Tarsier Conservation Area in Loboc. It’s a great privilege to see them up close and personal. This rare creature is something that you won’t practically see anywhere else in the country. A trip in this tarsier sanctuary won’t just help you realize the importance of tarsiers, but of all the animals as well.<p>

<p>To reach Tarsier Conservation Area, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>DIY Option: If you prefer to visit the Tarsier Conservation Area on your own, rent a scooter in the main tourist area of Panglao. It’s approximately a 1-hour drive (around 50 km) from Panglao to Loboc. Scooter rentals in Panglao cost around 300 – 350 pesos per day.<p>

<p>Tour Option: Alternatively, you can book a Bohol Countryside Tour from Panglao. This full-day tour includes the Tarsier Sanctuary, Chocolate Hills, Bilar Man-Made Forest, Loboc River Cruise, and Baclayon Church.<p>
