   <h1>Calle Crisologo</h1>
      <p>According to its history, Calle Crisologo was once known as Calle Escolta de Vigan in the fifteenth century where prosperous families built their houses because of the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade. Then in the twentieth century, it was named Calle Crisologo as a tribute to the late illustrious Ilocano writer and governor named Mena Pecson Crisologo since during his time he is admired and honored in the Ilocos region. In the 1940â€™s during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, many houses were wrecked by fire. Nonetheless, after the war, the burned houses were rebuilt and restored and later converted into inns, cafes, and souvenir shops selling various items such as antiques, furniture, accessories, and souvenirs. On the year 1999, Calle Crisologo was listed as a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) world heritage site because it displays a compact concentration of century houses as well as antique cobblestone where horse-drawn carriages are still used for day-to-day transportation. As of today, the 500-meter-long Calle Crisologo is visited by thousands of tourists every week and is the most photographed street in Vigan City.
        <br /><br />
        Calle Crisologo in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, is one of the most beautiful streets in the Philippines. It boasts centuries-old stone houses, lovely tungsten lamps, and antique cobblestone, where horse-drawn carriages or kalesas are still used for transport. In fact, the street is a pedestrian-only zone, save for kalesas favored for touring the historical sites around town. A few of the ancestral houses have also become restaurants that serve the famous Ilocos bagnet (deep fried pork belly) or empanadas. Meanwhile, others have been converted into inns and souvenir shops for traditional Inabel linen.<p>
