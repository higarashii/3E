   <h1>Butuan National Museum</h1>
    <p>The Butuan National Museum, located in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, is a treasure trove of artifacts that bear testament to the rich cultural heritage of the region. The museum serves as a repository of archaeological artifacts that prove Butuan’s prehistoric existence and cultural materials of the ethno-linguistic groups inhabiting the region such as Manobo, Mamanwa, Higaonon, and lowland Butuanons.<br>

One of the museum’s most significant exhibits is the Prehistoric and Archaeological Hall. This section showcases a variety of primitive artifacts, including specimens of stone crafts, metal crafts, potteries, gold smithing, burial coffins, and other artifacts recovered at diverse periods of man’s subsistence. Among these, the Golden Tara stands out, representing the relativity of Butuan to Indonesia. Another notable artifact is a bronze pestle, believed to have been brought by foreigners trading with the locals. The Ethnology Hall, another section of the museum, features artifacts and objects that highlight the cultural communities of the Manobo, Mamanwa, Higaonon, and the lowland Butuanons2. These include utensils, farming tools, baskets, fabrics and clothes, decorations, coffins, ceramic, human skulls, stones, gun, wooden paddles, and ornaments made of gold, silver, lead, copper, and bronzes.<p>
