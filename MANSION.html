   <h1>The Mansion</h1>
    <p>The Mansion in Baguio City is the official summer residence of the President of the Philippines. It is located on the eastern part of the city along C.P. Romulo Drive and right across from Wright Park. Built in 1908, it is older than the city itself and is one of the most visited and photographed landmarks of Baguio.Originally, the Mansion was built as summer homes for U.S. governor-generals, the American administrators for the Philippines. It was destroyed in 1945 during the battle for the liberation of the Philippines and was later rebuilt and improved by the Philippine government in 1947.<p>

<p>The Mansion has served various Philippine presidents during their official visits and engagements in Baguio City. It also houses a mini museum with memorabilia and works of art collected over its years of occupancy by the former presidents. The Mansion's elaborate main gate is said to be a replica of that at Buckingham Palace in London, England.The Mansion's architecture displays a blend of neo-gothic style and American influences. Its interior design combines elements of American, European, and Filipino aesthetics. It is surrounded by beautifully landscaped gardens that provide a refreshing and tranquil atmosphere.<p>
