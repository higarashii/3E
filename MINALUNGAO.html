      <h1>Minalungao National Park</h1>
    <p>Minalungao National Park is a protected area of the Philippines located in the municipality of General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, near its Boundary with Doña Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan. The park covers an area of 2,018 hectares centered along the scenic Peñaranda River bordered on both sides by up to 16-meter high limestone walls in the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountain range. It was established in 1967 by virtue of Republic Act No. 5100.<p>

<p>The park is considered one of the few remaining natural environments in this region north of Manila. It is promoted by the local government as an ecotourism destination offering breath-taking scenery of green pristine river and unique rock formations. A system of unexplored caverns have also been identified as potential attractions. Facilities for picnics, swimming, fishing, raft riding and cliff diving have likewise been put up to draw more visitors.<p>

<p>These days, a lot of city folk want a taste of the laid-back provincial life. When life gets too hectic in the metro, just heading somewhere you can float on a bamboo raft, enjoy simple home-cooked meals and see stunning natural sights can be just what you need to re-energize for the work week ahead. One of the fastest-rising destinations to offer this kind of experience near Manila is Minalungao National Park in Nueva Ecija.


<p>The allure of Minalungao National Park (as with all eco-tourism attractions) is its natural beauty. Unfortunately, with popularity comes development. The place has been developed to cater to the influx of tourists, with artificial structures, a hotel in the works and even a man-made swimming pool right next to the river catering to the crowds. To be honest, I wish the place only had native cottages or a camping site instead. I really think having artificial structures ruins the whole natural vibe of the place. The highlight of our visit for me was getting to sample some unique Novo Ecijano dishes that I hadn’t ever tried.<p>

<p>The word Minalungao was derived from the words Mina meaning mine and Lungao which is a local word for cave. It’s been a few years since photos of this destination started circulating on social media and has since become very popular with the weekend crowds. Locals say before the park was “discovered,” not a lot of tourists visited the province of Nueva Ecija. This natural sight put the once sleepy province on the map. The best time to visit to see the emerald green waters is around summer time. It rained before our visit, so we weren’t able to see the place in its full glory.<p>
