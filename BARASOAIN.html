   <h1>Barasoain Church</h1>
    <p>Barásoain Church (Tagalog: [ba'ɾaswa'in], official title: Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish) is a Roman Catholic church built in 1888[1] in Malolos, Bulacan, Philippines. It is about 42 kilometres (26 mi) from Manila. Having earned the title as the "Cradle of Democracy in the East, the most important religious building in the Philippines", and the site of the First Philippine Republic, the church is proverbial for its historical importance among Filipinos.<p>

<p>Barásoain was originally known as "Bangkál", a part of Encomienda of Malolos integrated by Miguel López de Legaspi with the town of Calumpit to the west on April 5, 1572. When the Augustinian friars made Malolos a separate town in 1580, Bangkál became a village under the jurisdiction of the town church. A hermitage made of nipa and bamboo was constructed near the river between Maluslos (Malolos población) and Barasoain for the people of Bangkál.<p>

<p>The name "Barásoain" was derived from Barásoain in Navarre, Spain, Named after the birthplace of Archbishop José Juliaàn de Aranguren (16 February 1801- 18 April 1861) 22 Archbishop of the Philippine archdiocese of the Latin branch of the Catholic Church from 1847 to 1861.<p>

<p>Another church building was commissioned and constructed on a new site, its present location—corner of Paseo del Congreso and Antonio Bautista streets. Under the supervision of Francisco Royo, the new church was built, made of light materials. In 1884, during the celebration of the Flores de Mayo the temporary church was burned.<p>
