   <h1>Art In Island</h1>
    <p>Art In Island is an interactive 3D art museum located in Quezon City, Philippines. It is known for its unique and immersive art installations that allow visitors to become a part of the artwork. Art In Island aims to redefine the traditional museum experience by encouraging visitors to actively engage with the art. It is located at 175 15th Ave, Cubao, Quezon City, 1109 Metro Manila</p>

<p>Art In Island was initially established in 2014 as the first and largest 3D art museum in the Philippines.But eight years later, it was revamped by a team of talented South Korean artists who specialized in computer design, sculpture, and crafts to offer a new immersive art experience to its patrons.</p>

<p>It closed its doors to the public for renovations on August 15, 2022 and reopened four months later as the new Art in Island: The Media Square. From a 3D art museum filled with contemporary paintings, the new Art In Island is now a combination of media and different art forms.</p>
