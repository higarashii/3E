   <h1>Philippine Eagle Foundation's Center for Philippine Raptors</h1>
    <p>

On our 35th year of being at the forefront of saving the critically endangered Philippine eagle, we recognize our milestones that advanced our mission. And as we leap forward to many more, we are rallying the Filipino people to join us in saving eagles, protecting forests, and securing our future.
<p>

<p>
Let us celebrate how far we have come in conserving our national bird. It is time to transform awareness into commitment and action that preserve our eagle and our forests. <p>

<p>Please be informed that the flight demonstration may be cancelled due to bad weather, unavailability of the birds or major technical difficulties. <p>
