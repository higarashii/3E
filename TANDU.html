   <h1>Tandu Beach</h1>
    <p>Tan duh Beach, often referred to as Tandu Beach, is a beautiful destination located in Parang, Sulu, in the Mindanao region of the Philippines. It’s known for its powdery white sand and serene atmosphere, offering a tropical paradise away from the more tourist-heavy spots. The beach is open to the public, and visitors can rent cottages during their stay<p>

<p>Tandu Beach is another must-see paradise boasting of white sandy beaches fringed by lush coconut groves. The turquoise waters add to the excitement. Despite its unspoiled beauty, it remains relatively unknown and only a few tourists come here every year.<p>

<p>Tandu Beach is part of the Sulu archipelago, an area that has been less traveled due to safety concerns, but it holds some of the most unspoiled beaches in the country. It’s important for travelers to coordinate with the Sulu Provincial Tourism Office for arrangements, including tour guides and police escorts, to ensure a safe and enjoyable visit.<p>

<p>Follow Local Protocols: Upon arrival in Jolo, wait for your tour guide before exiting the ferry. Respect and follow the instructions of your guide and police escort for your safety.<p>

        <h2>Sulu Peacekeepers Inn</h2>
        <p><strong>Information:</strong> <p>Located in Camp Asturias, Jolo Philippines.<p>
<p>It boasts contemporary design and comfortable accommodations suitable for both leisure and business travelers.<p>
<p>You can't really expect a very extravagant accommodation so it's already a nice place to stay. Secured as it is inside a police camp. Pillows are a bit hard, sheets are thin BUT, rooms are typically nice. Aircon is perfectly working. CR is very good. Bidet is a plus factor! Although there's no hot shower but nevertheless, it's still decent and a very nice place to stay in Jolo. There's also a restaurant inside so that's a plus factor as well. Sari-sari store for your snacks or toiletries can be found just in front of the inn. Would recommend this place if you'll stay in Jolo.</p>
