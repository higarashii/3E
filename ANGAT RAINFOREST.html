   <h1>Angat Rainforest and Eco Park</h1>
    <p>Angat Watershed is home to 290 endemic species of known non-woody and woody plants like bagtikan, tanguile and yakal no longer found in other forests in the country.<p>

<p>There are 66 recorded species of vertebrates in the watershed and 43 species of birds, making it a favored destination of bird watchers. Two of the most visible birds in the park are the Tarictic Hornbill or kalao (Penolopides panini manillae) and the Rufous Hornbill (Buceros hydrocopax).<p>

<p>The Angat Watershed Forest Reserve is located approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast of Metro Manila largely in the mountainous eastern region of Bulacan. It contains the headwaters of the Angat River, a tributary of the Rio Grande de Pampanga, and stretches along upper Angat River from San Jose del Monte and Rodriguez to Doña Remedios Trinidad, and extending to General Tinio and General Nakar.[3] The forest reserve is divided into two sub-catchment areas: the Forest Range and the Metro Water District.[10][11] The Angat Watershed and Forest Range, also known as the Angat Watershed Management Pilot Project Reserve, covers 6,600 hectares (16,000 acres) in San Jose del Monte, Norzagaray and Rodriguez, and supports the Ipo Dam, which has a capacity of 7,500,000 cubic metres (260,000,000 cu ft) and a spilling level of 101 metres (331 ft).<p>

<p>Two near-threatened mammals are known to roam the watershed forest at Angat, the crab-eating macaque and the Philippine warty pig.[3] It is also a known habitat of the Philippine deer.[2] Other rare species of note in the protected area include the blazed Luzon shrew rat, and 66 species of vertebrates, including the endemic Japanese bullet frog and marbled water monitor.[1] The Angat reservoir is stocked with huge tilapia and eel.<p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Angat Rainforest and Eco Park, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>By Public Transportation:<p>

<p>By Car or Motorcycle:
From Metro Manila, head north towards Commonwealth Avenue. Although Commonwealth Avenue is known as the “killer highway” due to accidents, traffic is usually lighter during Holy Week.
Traverse EDSA and Quezon Avenue, then continue on Commonwealth Avenue.
Once you reach Norzagaray, the real adventure begins. The route through the area known as Hilltop is popular with cyclists. Expect refreshing mountain views, cooler air, and scenic roads.
Pass by Bitbit Bridge, where you can take a short trail down to Bitbit River for a refreshing dip.
Across the bridge, you’ll find the gated entrance to Angat Rainforest and Eco Park (AREP). Pay a small fee of P25 per person to enter.<p>
<p>It's recommended to verify the specific routes and transportation options based on your starting point and current travel conditions. Additionally, always exercise caution and follow local traffic regulations while traveling.<p>
