   <h1> Barracuda Lake </h1>
    <p>Barracuda Lake, or locally known as Luluyuan Lake, is named for the barracuda skeleton that was discovered at the bottom of its waters many years ago. However, barracudas are now rarely found in the lake (it’s perfectly safe for diving!), and the presence of this fish is not what makes Barracuda Lake special.
<br><br> Barracuda Lake, Coron, Palawan is a thermocline freshwater lake. It means that the lake has layers of water with varying temperatures and densities. Divers and snorkelers will instantly feel the sudden change in temperature as they swim in the water.
Above the calm turquoise-green water of Barracuda Lake is a haven for those seeking peace. It is surrounded by tall limestone rock formations that are about 50 meters in height. While underwater is a home for different vibrant marine species. A perfect place for divers and free-divers of all levels.
<br><br> Whether you are seeking for a place to relax or is seeking underwater adventures, Barracuda Lake offers exceptional experiences that can be added to your bucket list.
</p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>Nearest Airport:</b> Francisco B. Reyes Airport, also known as Busuanga Airport (Palawan) <br><br> BY AIR<br>
1. Coming from Manila, this is the most convenient and fastest way to go to Coron Island where Barracuda Lake is located. It will take you around 1 hour to get to Busuanga Airport. Check your preferred airline company for the flight schedule and airfare.
<br>2. Once in Busuanga Airport, ride a van going to Coron town proper (P150). Travel time is 30-45 minutes.
<br>3. Note: There are no taxis or tricycles at the airport; only vans shuttle guests from the airport to Coron town proper. These vans can drop you off at your hotel. You can rent the van for P1500 if you’re a big group.
<br>4. From the town proper, you can either join a group tour (Coron Island Tour) or charter a private boat going to Barracuda Lake.<br><br> Other than flying, you can also try the ferry routes operating from Manila or from Puerto Princesa and other parts of Palawan. From either Manila or Puerto Princesa, the trip to the Coron pier takes around 15 hours.
