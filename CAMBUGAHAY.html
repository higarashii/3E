<p>There are a couple of options when searching for how to get to Cambugahay Falls in Siquijor, and they are by scooter, habal habal, or tricycle.You can rent a scooter in Siquijor for as little as 250 pesos per day and make your own way over to Cambugahay Waterfalls.

When you arrive in Siquijor by ferry, you’ll find that there are half a dozen scooter rental stores located at the ferry terminal which is super convenient. You can pick up a set of wheels for the time you plan to spend on Siquijor Island.

The cost depends on how good your bartering skills are, though for a 30-minute drive you can expect to pay around 150-200 pesos.<p>
