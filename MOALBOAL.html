<p> Moalboal Philippines is a tiny fishing town on the western coast of Cebu Island in the Central Visayas region. It may only have a small population of around 30,000 inhabitants but this little town was one of our favourite places to stay whilst backpacking in the Philippines. Since 1970 Moalboal has evolved into a main tourist attraction due to its breathtaking underwater paradise, and has now become one of the top scuba destinations of the world. A great majority believe that Moalboal was founded by settlers coming from Bohol Island. In this connection, it has been said that one Laurente Sabanal of Bohol who was captured by the Spaniards for killing a “guardia civil” escaped from his captors, took a small boat to Southern Cebu.
