   <h1>Hermena Menor and Hermena Major Island</h1>
    <p>These two sister islands are called Hermana Menor (little sister) and Hermana Mayor (elder sister). They may not be as famous as the other islands of Zambales but their raw, isolated beauty and crystalline waters are beyond compare.<p>

<p>When I recently went home (proud Zambaleña here!) for the Holy Week break, I was itching to discover something new in my province. The lure of the two mysterious islands of Sta. Cruz, which I’ve only encountered through pass-on stories, kept me on my toes. I researched on the best possible and affordable way on how to go to Hermana Menor and Hermana Mayor—since I was told countless times that the islands are privately-owned and are off-limits to the public. <p>

<p>Our first stop was the smaller of the two islands—Hermana Menor. Truth be told, I lowered my expectations for Hermana Menor because someone told me it isn’t that breathtaking. But as we set sail in a narrow outrigger boat, my anxiety and pre-disappointment was blown away by the sea waves and the salt air.  I was ready to be awed.<p>

<p>Secluded and undiscovered, Hermana Menor is privately owned by Palawan Governor Jose Alvarez and the Hernandez family of Zambales. To the locals of Zambales, Hermana Menor is also known as Makatira Island. According to the caretaker, Manong Dodong, Hermana Menor used to be an inhabited community but eventually, locals sold their lots. Today, Hermana Menor or Makatira Island, which spans 102 hectares, is the ideal beach escapade for someone looking for seclusion and serenity.<p>

    <h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>To reach Hermena Menor and Hermena Major Island, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>By Public Transportation:<p>

<p>1. Ride a bus from Metro Manila bound for Santa Cruz, Zambales (e.g. Victory Liner in Monumento, Caloocan).<p>
<p>2. Remind the bus conductor to drop you off at Petron Gas Station of Barangay Lipay, Santa Cruz (travel time: 5 – 6 hours).<p>

<p>By Private Vehicle:<p>
<p>1. Staying overnight in the island is not allowed that’s why you really need to depart from Manila at midnight (or earlier) so you could at least arrive in the island at around 8am. I bet you don’t want to arrive late and spend lesser time in the island. The island closes at 5pm. You need to leave the island on or before 5pm.<p>

<p>It's recommended to verify the specific routes and transportation options based on your starting point and current travel conditions. Additionally, always exercise caution and follow local traffic regulations while traveling.<p>
