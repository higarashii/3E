   <h1>NACPAN BEACH, PALAWAN</h1>
    <p>Nacpan Beach itself is more than 4km of powdery white sand glory; one of two beautiful beaches known as Twin Beach which have largely remained off most tourists’ radars compared to other hotspots in El Nido. The other beach is Calitang Beach, which is just to the south and easy to reach on foot. From a top the surrounding hills, there are spectacular views across both beaches and beyond to Lalutaya Island.

Nacpan Beach is one of the most beautiful stretches of sand in the Philippines. With four kilometres of soft cream-coloured sand, swaying coconut palms, a fishing village, clear aqua water and small surfable waves, it’s the kind of place you’d see if you closed your eyes and imagined paradise. Nacpan Beach is a four-kilometer strip of cream-colored sand and coconut trees with crystal clear turquoise water. It is located 17th kilometers north of the El Nido town proper in Palawan. This powdery paradise was one of the secret getaways for some tourists until its beauty was discovered by many and eventually became one of the most popular tourist spots in El Nido. In 2016, it was voted the world’s 10th best beach by users of travel rating website Trip Advisor.</p>

	<h1>How to get there</h1>
<p>The most convenient and comfortable way is to book an El Nido transfer shuttle service, which is usually part of organized tours going to Nacpan Beach. This is also a great way to meet other travelers as you will most likely share the service with other people. For a more authentic island experience, you can hop on a tricycle to get to Nacpan Beach. While this is cheaper, expect a more bumpy ride as some parts of the road going to the beach are not fully cemented and are sometimes muddy. You can also rent a motorbike and drive your way to Nacpan. Most budget travelers and thrill-seekers opt to do this since rental rates for an entire day are cheaper than a shuttle or tricycle service, plus they also have the freedom to go at their own pace and explore other places around Nacpan Beach and the rest of El Nido. As mentioned, some roads leading to Nacpan are still not in great condition, so be extra careful when choosing this transport option.</p>
