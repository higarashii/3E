<p>By Flights and Ferry:<p>

<p>Habal-Habal (Motorcycle):<p>
<p>1. If you're traveling by private vehicle from nearby towns or cities, you can use online maps or navigation apps to guide you to Siargao Island.<p>
<p>2. If you're traveling solo or in a small group, you can hire local motorcycle drivers to give you a lift or drive them yourself. These motorcycles for hire are locally known as habal-habal. It's a popular mode of transportation in many small islands in the Philippines, especially in the southern provinces.<p>

<p>Mini-Multicab Rental-
If you’re only traveling with a small group of three to four, a van rental may not be economical. A good alternative would be renting a mini-multicab. Binggo offers the first and only private mini multicabs for rent in Siargao.<p>
