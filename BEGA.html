   <h1>BEGA FALLS</h1>
    <p>Bega Falls is located in Barangay Mabuhay, Prosperidad, Agusan del Su. Bega Falls is considered as one of the most amazing waterfalls in the entire province of Agusan del Sur. It is a 4-tier falls of refreshing and cold waters hidden in the jungles of the province. Each falls has its own catch basin good for swimming. However, the first tier or the topmost waterfall is the most impressive of them all. The water cascades on the gigantic limestone boulder down the wide basin below. Picnicking, swimming and cliff-jumping are the best things to do here.<p>

<p>It still unpopular place for Filipinos but this falls has enormous potential in tourism not only in Mindanao but in the whole Philippines. Prior to my visit, my expectation was not that high and I thought it's just an ordinary fall that a must to visit when you're in Agusan. But when I saw the falls, the first word that comes into my mind was "wow". It's big and enormously beautiful. Unlike other falls that are crowded due to its popularity. The Bega falls still enjoys majority by their locals and other Mindanao's. So coming here on weekdays might surprise you that you will have the falls exclusively.<p>

	<h1>HOW TO GET THERE</h1>
<p>To reach Bega Falls, you can follow these general directions:<p>

<p>1. As the future is nothing but uncertainties, at the time of writing getting on a flight to Butuan is the quickest way for you to biga at Bega Falls. Other options are the airports in and Surigao and Davao. Unless you're taking the route from Surigao which doesn't pass through Butuan, the point where you need to get off when taking public transportation is at Awa Junction (intersection) located in Prosperidad. It's around 1.5 hours from Butuan and farther when coming from Davao<p>
<p>2. If you're taking public transportation all the way, there should be motorcycles known as "habal-habal" at Awa that can take you to Bega Falls which is part of Barangay Mabuhay. These rides are notorious for rough roads but you can bet on your sorry ass that there's not gonna be any of it as there's already a concrete road network all the way to the stairs.<p>

<p>It's recommended to verify the specific routes and transportation options based on your starting point and current travel conditions. Additionally, always exercise caution and follow local traffic regulations while traveling.<p>
